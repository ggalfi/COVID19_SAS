# COVID19_SAS

My intentions was two-folded when I went through this analysis.

First: I wanted to get answer for a frequently arising question: how many people have COVID-19 in a certain country/region. Having this number is a must for a lot of calculatons, for example to estimate somehow the mortality rate. But the problem is that the officially available data is highly unreliable becasue of a few good reasons. So I tried to find the answer with Bayesian analysis. What even surprised me, that pretty stable and consistent results were came out from this analysis.
See the [report](https://github.com/ggalfi/COVID19_SAS/raw/master/doc/covid19mcmc.pdf) I have written on this topic.

Second: This analysis is a very good example of usefullnes of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method which I've relied on during the analysis. So [grab somewhere a SAS University Edition](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition/download-software.html) (don't worry, it's free) download this repository which contains all the data and sas code I've used in this report and you are ready to jump into the interesting world of Bayesian analysis.
